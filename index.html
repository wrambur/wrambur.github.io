<h1> Will Rambur </h1>
<div class="main" id="page-wrap">
<p> My name is Will. I study Electrical Engineering at the University of Vermont. 
A few friends of mine have been making websites, so I figured I'm jump on the bandwagon.
I know there isn't much on here now, but hopefully there will be more to come.
