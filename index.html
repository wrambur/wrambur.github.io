<h1 align="center"> Will Rambur </h1>
<p> My name is Will. <br> I study Electrical Engineering at the University of Vermont. 
<br> A few friends of mine have been making websites, so I figured I'm jump on the bandwagon.
<br> I know there isn't much on here now, but hopefully there will be more to come.
